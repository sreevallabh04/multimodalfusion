# 📌 Non-Destructive Mango Fruit Disease Classification Using Simulated Multi-Modal Deep Learning

## 📖 1. Project Overview

### What Problem Does This Solve?

Imagine you're a farmer with thousands of mango fruits ready for harvest. Some fruits look healthy on the outside but might have internal diseases that make them unsellable. Traditional methods to check for diseases are either:

- **🔪 Destructive**: Cut open the fruit to inspect (destroys the product)
- **💰 Expensive**: Use thermal cameras, hyperspectral sensors, or X-ray machines
- **⏰ Time-consuming**: Manual inspection by experts

### Our Solution

This project creates an **intelligent system** that can detect mango diseases using only **regular smartphone photos** (RGB images). Here's the innovation:

🎯 **The Challenge**: We want thermal imaging benefits without expensive thermal cameras  
🧠 **Our Approach**: Use artificial intelligence to "simulate" thermal maps from regular photos  
🚀 **The Result**: 88.89% accuracy in disease detection using only a smartphone camera  

### Why This Matters

- **👨‍🌾 For Farmers**: Detect diseases early, save crops, increase income
- **🏭 For Industry**: Automate quality control in packing facilities
- **🌍 For Society**: Reduce food waste, ensure food safety
- **📱 For Technology**: Deployable on mobile devices worldwide

## 📦 2. Dataset Explanation

Our system uses two different but cleverly connected datasets:

### 🥭 MangoFruitDDS Dataset (Main Classification Target)
- **Purpose**: Train our system to recognize diseases in actual fruits
- **Content**: 838 high-quality mango fruit images
- **Categories**: 5 disease types
  - ✅ **Healthy**: Perfect fruits with no diseases
  - 🟤 **Anthracnose**: Dark spots and lesions on fruit surface
  - 🟡 **Alternaria**: Yellow-brown patches with concentric rings
  - ⚫ **Black Mould Rot**: Black fungal growth (Aspergillus)
  - 🔴 **Stem and Rot**: Decay starting from the stem end
- **Usage**: This is what our system learns to classify

### 🍃 MangoLeafBD Dataset (Thermal Simulation Helper)
- **Purpose**: Train a "lesion detector" to understand disease patterns
- **Content**: 4,000 mango leaf images
- **Categories**: 8 different leaf diseases including healthy leaves
- **Key Innovation**: We use leaf disease patterns to simulate how diseases might appear in thermal imaging on fruits

### 🔗 The Connection
Think of it like this: if you're a doctor, you might learn about internal problems by studying X-rays, then apply that knowledge to diagnose patients using external symptoms. Similarly:

1. **Step 1**: Train AI on leaf diseases (learns what disease "looks like")
2. **Step 2**: Apply that knowledge to generate "thermal-like" maps on fruits
3. **Step 3**: Use both regular photos AND simulated thermal maps for better disease detection

## 🧠 3. Technical Architecture

Our system works like a multi-step assembly line. Here's how:

### 📊 Step 1: Data Preprocessing
```
Raw Images → Resize to 224x224 pixels → Split into:
├── 70% Training (586 fruit + 2800 leaf images)
├── 15% Validation (126 fruit + 600 leaf images)  
└── 15% Testing (126 fruit + 600 leaf images)
```

### 🔍 Step 2: Lesion Detector Training
```
Leaf Images → CNN Model → Learns to detect:
├── Healthy tissue patterns
├── Disease signature patterns
├── Location of lesions
└── Severity indicators
```
**What it does**: This model becomes our "disease pattern expert"

### 🌡️ Step 3: Thermal Map Simulation
```
Fruit RGB Image → Lesion Detector → Probability Map → Apply Heat Simulation:
├── High disease probability = Higher temperature (red/yellow)
├── Low disease probability = Lower temperature (blue/green)
├── Add Gaussian blur (heat spreads naturally)
└── Add realistic noise
```
**Result**: Grayscale "thermal" image showing where diseases likely are

### 🎨 Step 4: RGB Baseline Model
```
Fruit RGB Images → ResNet18 CNN → Feature Extraction → Classification:
├── Learns color patterns
├── Learns texture patterns  
├── Learns shape deformations
└── Outputs: Disease probability for each class
```
**Performance**: 82.54% accuracy using only regular photos

### 🔀 Step 5: Multi-Modal Fusion Model
```
RGB Image ────┐
              ├── Attention-Based Fusion → Final Classification
Thermal Map ──┘
```

**How Fusion Works**:
1. **RGB Branch**: Processes color information (like human vision)
2. **Thermal Branch**: Processes simulated heat patterns (like thermal vision)
3. **Attention Mechanism**: Decides which information is most important
4. **Fusion Layer**: Combines both types of information intelligently

### 📈 Step 6: Training & Evaluation
```
Training:
├── Feed thousands of image pairs (RGB + thermal)
├── Model learns to combine information optimally
├── Validate on unseen data to prevent overfitting
└── Save best performing model

Evaluation:
├── Test on completely unseen images
├── Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
├── Generate confusion matrices
└── Create interpretability visualizations (CAM)
```

### 🔬 Step 7: Interpretability (CAM Visualizations)
```
Trained Model → Class Activation Maps → Visual Explanation:
├── Shows which parts of the image the model focuses on
├── Highlights disease-relevant regions
├── Provides trust and transparency
└── Helps validate model decisions
```
