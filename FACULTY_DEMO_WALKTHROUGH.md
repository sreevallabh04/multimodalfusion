## 1. Opening Statement (30 seconds)

> ‚ÄúGood [morning/afternoon], ma‚Äôam/sir. I‚Äôm excited to present our research project:  
> **‚ÄòCross-Modal Knowledge Transfer for Cost-Effective Multi-Modal Agricultural Disease Detection‚Äô**.  
> This project is designed to help farmers detect mango diseases using only regular smartphone photos, by simulating advanced thermal imaging with AI.‚Äù

---

## 2. Project Motivation & Problem Statement (1 minute)

> ‚ÄúMango diseases cause huge losses globally, but advanced detection methods like thermal cameras are too expensive for most farmers.  
> Our goal was to achieve the accuracy of multi-modal (RGB + thermal) systems, but using only standard RGB images‚Äîmaking it affordable and accessible.‚Äù

---

## 3. Key Innovations (1 minute)

> ‚ÄúOur project introduces two main innovations:
> 1. **Thermal Simulation via Knowledge Transfer:** We train a model on leaf disease patterns and use it to simulate realistic thermal maps for mango fruits, without needing a real thermal camera.
> 2. **Attention-Based Fusion:** We use a transformer-inspired attention mechanism to intelligently combine RGB and simulated thermal features for better disease classification.‚Äù

**Tip:**  
Practice running these commands and explaining each step. If you want to show a live inference, have a test image ready in your project folder.

If you need a shorter or more technical version, let me know! 

To run this project and see the accuracy you get, follow these steps (based on the README):

### 1. **Set Up the Environment**
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
pip install -r project/requirements.txt
```

### 2. **Download the Datasets**
- Download the datasets as described in the README (usually from a release link or as described in `project/setup.md`).
- Extract them to `project/data/`.

### 3. **Train the Model**
Navigate to the `project` directory and run:
```bash
cd project
python train.py --backbone resnet50 --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
```
This will train the model and save the best checkpoints.

### 4. **Evaluate the Model and Show Accuracy**
After training, run:
```bash
python evaluate.py --rgb_model_path "models/checkpoints/rgb_*_best.pth" \
                   --fusion_model_path "models/checkpoints/fusion_*_best.pth"
```
This script will print out the accuracy and other metrics for your trained models.
